Wow.


Just wow.


This is awesome, Ava. The game play works just as it should,
and you got the default Y/N option working as suggested in
the assignment. You also took the initiative to include the
graphical option for the dice--a very nice touch!

Add to all of that the fact that you have the beginnings of
a betting option, with the player able to enter an amount and
either have that money won or lost depending on the outcome
of the game. You've already done most of the hard work--you
might consider including the ability for a user to begin
the game with a set amount of money, and then track their
money for as long as they keep playing.

It wouldn't be hard! You should absolutely use git to track
the changes, however, because it may be that you'll want
to hop back and forth between some different versions.

The one criticism I'll make is a small one--when offering the
default response option (as you did), the standard in a 
text-based game is to indicate what the default response will
be as a capital letter. So, Wanna play craps? (Y/n) would
suggest that hitting enter will invoke the Yes response. That
way the user knows what to expect when they hit Enter. 

Oh, and don't ask if I want the instructions. That gets 
annoying. ;)

Such good work, Ava. Keep it up!

SCORE: 57/50
